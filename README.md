# HomemadeDNS
Do you need a DynDNS server for free? Just do it yourself with your website!  
(you need a web hosting, also a free plan is okay!)

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo on a linux device of the local network (best if a always-on device, like a Raspberry Pi): `git clone https://github.com/daquinoaldo/HomemadeDNS.git`;
2. Navigate into the folder with `cd HomemadeDNS`and execute the setup script `bash setup.sh`;
3. Follow the instructions and enjoy.
