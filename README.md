# HomemadeDNS
Do you need a DynDNS server for free? Just do it yourself with your website!
(you need a web hosting, also a free plan is okay!)

# Instructions
1. Clone the repo on a linux device of the local network (best if a always-on device, like a Raspberry Pi): "git clone https://github.com/daquinoaldo/HomemadeDNS.git"
2. Navigate "cd HomemadeDNS", give the execution permissions "chmod +x setup.sh" and then execute "./setup.sh"
3. Follow the instructions and enjoy
